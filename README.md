## Introduction

One of the most important things in any given person’s life is the food they eat. Every day we try to make new meals and keep things fresh, for otherwise food tastes bland and the flavors get boring. The most common way people get new meal ideas to cook at home is through online recipes. As such this project looks to provide a data scientist’s point of view into what makes a given recipe highly rated, and popular.

The data from this project is provided by food.com, a digital brand, and online social networking service featuring recipes from home cooks and celebrity chefs. To start with, there were two datasets, one that detailed the recipes (we’ll call this **recipes**) and another that detailed the ratings (we’ll call this **ratings**).
